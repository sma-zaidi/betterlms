* Click on the button, and select OK on the confirmation box that pops up to start downloading the site.
* You can now close the tab or navigate away and the downloads will continue in the background.

## Notes
* Please allow a 5-10 seconds for the downloads to start. May take longer depending on the size of the site.
* Currently the only way to cancel the downloading process before completion is to restart Chrome.
* There's no way to skip folders atm. If you want to skip a file, cancel the file's download manually and it'll move on to the next one.
