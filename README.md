# BetterLMS

BetterLMS is an extension for Google Chrome that lets you download entire sites off of the LUMS LMS.

## Installation
Download and extract source code to a folder

Folder should now contain a file called manifest.json

Chrome > manage extensions > enable developer mode > load unpacked > select folder containing manifest.json

## Usage
* Visit the resources tab for the site you want to download.
* Locate the 'download site' button just above the site content.
* Click on the button, and select OK on the confirmation box that pops up to start downloading the site.
* You can now close the tab or navigate away and the downloads will continue in the background.

## Notes
* Please allow a 5-10 seconds for the downloads to start. May take longer depending on the size of the site.
* Currently the only way to cancel the downloading process before completion is to restart Chrome.
* There's no way to skip folders atm. If you want to skip a file, cancel the file's download manually and it'll move on to the next one.
